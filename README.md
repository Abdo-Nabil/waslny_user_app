## ⚡&ensp;Notes
* The app currently isn't completed yet, but the main goals for making an app like this are done and covered by the mentioned topics above.

* Maybe in the future, I can invest more time to finish the app.

* To use this project on your machine, you need to set up firebase for this project.

* You need also to have mapsApiKey for Maps SDk & fcmServerKey for notifications.

* Put the mapsApiKey & fcmServerKey constants in a file called 'constants.dart' or deal as you like.
